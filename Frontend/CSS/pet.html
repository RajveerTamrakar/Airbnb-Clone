                <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
                    extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first
                    species to be domesticated by humans.

            <p>The cat, commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the
                family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat
                occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.</p>
